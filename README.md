# Programming-with-python
### This course, namely Advanced Programming with Python, was introduced by Maktabkhoone. One of the greatest features of this course is that the teacher, Jadi Mirmirani, is an expert in programming.

Start with the Introduction:
- Read the introductory section of the README file. This section usually provides an overview of the course, its objectives, and what you can expect to learn.
Understand the Course Structure:

**First Season - Regular Syntax in Python**:
Focus on the section related to the first season. This section should provide details about what topics will be covered, any prerequisites, and possibly some initial exercises or assignments.

**Second Season - Object-Oriented Programming**:
Continue to the second season section. Again, look for details on the topics covered and any prerequisites or exercises. Understanding object-oriented programming is essential in Python.

**Third Season - Working with Databases**:
Move on to the third season, which involves working with databases. Note if there are any specific database technologies or libraries covered. Understanding how to interact with databases is crucial in many Python applications.

**Fourth Season - Web Scraping with Python**:
Review the section on web scraping. Check if it mentions the tools or libraries you'll be using for web scraping. Web scraping is a valuable skill for data acquisition and analysis.

**Fifth Season - Django API and Machine Learning**:
Explore the fifth season, which seems to include Django API and machine learning. Look for details on what aspects of Django and machine learning will be covered. This section likely builds on the earlier seasons.

**Final Project:**
This is where you'll likely apply what I've learned throughout the course. Understand the project requirements and expectations.
